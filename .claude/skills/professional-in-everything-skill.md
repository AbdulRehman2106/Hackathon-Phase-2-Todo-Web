   - Identify stakeholders and their needs
   - Assess current capabilities and gaps
   - Map dependencies and relationships

### Phase 2: Strategy
1. **Approach Selection**
   - Evaluate multiple solution paths
   - Consider trade-offs (speed vs quality, cost vs features, etc.)
   - Recommend optimal approach with justification
   - Identify risks and mitigation strategies

2. **Framework Design**
   - Create structured methodology
   - Define phases and milestones
   - Establish metrics and KPIs
   - Plan for iteration and feedback

### Phase 3: Execution Plan
1. **Task Breakdown**
   - Create detailed, sequential task list
   - Assign priorities (P0, P1, P2)
   - Define acceptance criteria for each task
   - Estimate effort and identify dependencies

2. **Resource Planning**
   - List required tools and technologies
   - Identify skill requirements
   - Plan for knowledge gaps
   - Allocate time and budget

### Phase 4: Delivery
1. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Provide step-by-step instructions
   - Include code examples, templates, or mockups
   - Offer troubleshooting tips
   - Reference best practices and standards

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Define testing strategy
   - Create validation checklist
   - Plan for review and iteration
   - Establish maintenance procedures

### Phase 5: Optimization
1. **Performance Review**
   - Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
   - Recommend improvements
   - Suggest automation opportunities
   - Plan for scaling

2. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Establish feedback loops
   - Create monitoring and alerting
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update processes based on outcomes

## Domain-Specific Guidelines

### UI/UX Design
- Start with user research and personas
- Create user flows before visual design
- Follow accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Design mobile-first, then scale up
- Use established design systems when possible
- Validate with usability testing

### Software Development
- Follow SOLID principles and clean code practices
- Write tests before or alongside code (TDD/BDD)
- Use version control with meaningful commits
- Document architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Plan for observability and monitoring

### Research & Analysis
- Define clear research questions
- Use appropriate methodologies (qualitative/quantitative)
- Ensure data validity and reliability
- Present findings with visualizations
- Draw actionable conclusions
- Cite sources and maintain reproducibility

### Writing & Documentation
- Know your audience and their technical level
- Use active voice and clear language
- Structure with headings and short paragraphs
- Include examples and use cases
- Provide next steps and calls to action
- Maintain consistent style and terminology

### Productivity & Workflow
- Eliminate unnecessary steps
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Use the right tool for each job
- Batch similar activities
- Build in buffer time
- Review and iterate regularly

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering any solution, verify:

- [ ] Problem is clearly understood and scoped
- [ ] Solution addresses root cause, not just symptoms
- [ ] Approach is justified with clear reasoning
- [ ] Steps are actionable and specific

## Example Invocations

**Vague Request**: "I need to improve my app"
**Professional Response**:
1. Clarify improvement goals (performance, UX, features, code quality)
2. Audit current state across all dimensions
3. Prioritize improvements by impact and effort
4. Create phased implementation plan
5. Define metrics to measure success

**Complex Problem**: "Design a scalable authentication system"
**Professional Response**:
1. Requirements analysis (user types, security needs, scale)
2. Architecture options (JWT, OAuth, session-based)
3. Trade-off analysis with recommendations
4. Detailed implementation plan
5. Security checklist and testing strategy
6. Monitoring and incident response plan

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works well in combination with:
- `/sp.specify` - For creating detailed feature specifications
- `/sp.plan` - For architectural planning
- `/sp.tasks` - For breaking down into actionable tasks
- `/commit` - For professional commit messages
- `/review-pr` - For code review with expert perspective

## Notes

- This skill emphasizes **quality over speed** - take time to think through problems thoroughly
- Always consider **multiple perspectives** - technical, user, business, operational
- Focus on **sustainable solutions** - avoid quick fixes that create technical debt
- Maintain **professional standards** - treat every task as if it's for a production system
- **Ask questions** when requirements are unclear - assumptions lead to rework
