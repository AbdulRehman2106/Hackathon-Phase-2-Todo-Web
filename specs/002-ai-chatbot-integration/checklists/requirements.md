# Specification Quality Checklist: AI Todo Chatbot Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:
- 7 user stories defined with clear priorities (P1-P4)
- 18 functional requirements specified
- 13 success criteria defined (10 measurable outcomes + 3 business outcomes)
- 9 edge cases identified
- 3 key entities documented
- 9 assumptions documented
- All acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- No implementation details in requirements (only in Assumptions section where appropriate)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for planning phase (`/sp.plan`)
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and unambiguous
- User stories are independently testable and prioritized for incremental delivery
- Success criteria include both quantitative metrics and qualitative measures
